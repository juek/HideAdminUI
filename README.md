# Hide Admin UI plugin for Typesetter CMS #

## About

When logged-in and editing pages, this plugin lets you hide/unhide all admin user interface elements by pressing *[Ctrl]+[H]*. 

* No need to log-off anymore to see the pages &lsquo;undisturbed&rsquo; as they appear to visitors.
* Hides Admin Menu, Admin Top Bar and possible open Editor Panel, modal Admin Box or the Messages Bbar.
* To exit the hidden state, press *[Ctrl]+[H]* once again, *[Esc]* or click the blinking indicator icon in the top right corner of the viewport.
* For better mobile device simulation, the admin UI auto-hides when the viewport becomes less than 992px wide.
