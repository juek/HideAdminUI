# Hide Admin UI plugin for Typesetter CMS #

## About ##

When logged-in and editing pages, this plugin lets you hide/unhide all admin user interface elements by clicking the new top-left icon in the Admin Top Bar or pressing *[Ctrl]+[H]*. 

* No need to log-off anymore to see the pages &lsquo;undisturbed&rsquo;, just like they appear to visitors.
* Hides Admin Menu, Admin Top Bar and possible open Editor Panel, modal Admin Box or the Messages Bar.
* To exit the hidden state, simply press *[Esc]* or *[Ctrl]+[H]* again or click the blinking indicator icon in the top left corner of the viewport.
* For better mobile device simulation, the admin UI auto-hides when the viewport becomes less than 992px wide.
